    "title": "Is Kaitlyn Hord the Most Underutilized Player in NCAA Volleyball?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Coming into the 2022 season, Nebraska needed more depth and experience at the middle blocker position. Kaitlyn Hord was the perfect player to step into that role for Nebraska. However, this season has been quite different than her seasons at Penn State statistically. She has not carried as much of an offensive load. At Penn State, Hord was second on the team in kills, only behind six-rotation, right side hitter, Jonni Parker. This season, she ranks sixth in total kills for the Cornhuskers.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\nbigten <- read_csv(\"bigtenvb.csv\")\n\nplayers <- read_csv(\"bigtenvb.csv\")\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\npennstatenebraska <- bigten %>%\n  filter(\n    Position == \"MB\" | Position == \"OH\" | Position == \"RS\" &\n    is.na(Team) == FALSE,\n    Team == \"Nebraska\" & Season == \"2022\" | Team == \"Penn State\" & Season == \"2021\"\n  )\n\nkhnebraska <- pennstatenebraska %>% \n  filter(Player == \"Hord, Kaitlyn\" & Season == \"2022\")\n\nkhpennstate <- pennstatenebraska %>% \n  filter(Player == \"Hord, Kaitlyn\" & Season == \"2021\")\n\nnewplayers <- players %>%\n  filter(BLK > 0,\n         K > 0) %>%\n  mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\nKH <- newplayers %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Hord, Kaitlyn\")\n\nothermiddles <- newplayers %>%\n  filter(Player %in% c(\"Rettke, Dana\", \"Holland, Allie\", \"Smrek, Anna\", \"Colvin, Raven\", \"Rader, Rylee\"))\n\npsu21 <- bigten %>%\n    filter(Team == \"Penn State\",\n           K > 50,\n           Season == \"2021\") %>%\n  group_by(Player)\n\npennstatetotal <- psu21 %>% top_n(5, wt=K)\n\nnebraska22 <- bigten %>%\n  filter(Team == \"Nebraska\",\n         K > 50,\n         Season == \"2022\") %>%\ngroup_by(Player)\n\nnebraskatotal <- nebraska22 %>% top_n(5, wt=K)\n\nkhpennstate <- bigten %>% filter(Player == \"Hord, Kaitlyn\", Season == \"2021\")\nkhnebraska <- bigten %>% filter(Player == \"Hord, Kaitlyn\", Season == \"2022\")\n\nbar1 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=pennstatetotal, aes(x=reorder(Player, K), weight=K), fill=\"grey\") +  \n  geom_bar(data=khpennstate, aes(x=reorder(Player, K), weight=K), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"Hord currently has about half the kills she had last season as a Nittany Lion.\", subtitle = \"She is still a great player, so what could the explanation for this be?\",  x=\"\", y=\"Player\", caption = \"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = -1.25, size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\nbar2 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=nebraskatotal, aes(x=reorder(Player, K), weight=K), fill=\"grey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=khnebraska, aes(x=reorder(Player, K),weight=K), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"\", subtitle= \"\", x=\"\", y=\"\",  caption=\"Source: Univeristy Websites | By Maddie Reisbig\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\nplot_grid(bar1, bar2, ncol=1)\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first thought when seeing these numbers instantly goes to setting. Not only have the 2022 Cornhuskers seen every combination of setters possible, but they are also mostly running a 6-2. This may have a part in why Hord is getting fewer kills this year. In a 6-2 the setter always has a third option in the front row and does not have to force middle as much. Last year, the Nittany Lions ran a 5-1 with setter Gabby Blossom. Running a 5-1 meant that for three rotations, Blossom only had two options, one of which was a middle.\nI wanted to look closer to see if it is truly setting that is causing Hord’s numbers to be lower this year. An easy way to see if setting has a role in it is by looking at hitting percentages. I assumed that in general, Nebraska’s 2022 hitting percentages would be lower than Penn State’s 2021 hitting percentages.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=pennstatenebraska,\n    groupOnX=TRUE,\n    aes(x=Team, y=PCT), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=pennstatenebraska, \n    aes(x=Team, y=PCT, label=Player), size=3) +\n    geom_beeswarm(\n    data=khnebraska,\n    groupOnX=TRUE,\n    aes(x=Team, y=PCT), color=\"red\", size=5) +\n    geom_beeswarm(\n    data=khpennstate,\n    groupOnX=TRUE,\n    aes(x=Team, y=PCT), color=\"blue\", size=5) +\n  labs(title=\"Could setting have something to do with Hord having a lower hitting percetage this season?\", subtitle=\"Three 2021 Penn State players had higher hitting percentages than any 2022 Nebraska player.\", x=\"Team\", y=\"Hitting Percentage\", caption=\"Source: Team Websites | By Maddie Reisbig\")  + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 10.25, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from this beeswarm chart, Penn State 2021 in general had higher hitting percentages than Nebraska 2022. One really noticeable aspect of this chart is the middles’ hitting percentages. Allie Holland, Katie Clark, and Kaitlyn Hord all had higher hitting percentages for Penn State last year than both Bekka Allick and Kaitlyn Hord do this year for Nebraska. It is also important to point out that Kaitlyn Hord hit nearly a full point higher last year. After looking at this chart, I think it is safe to say that setting may be having an impact on the attacking statistics this year for the Cornhuskers.\nThe setting position for Nebraska this year has been anything but consistent. It has been plagued by injuries, whereas, the setting was consistent last year for the Nittany Lions with Blossom at the helm. Hames, Orr, and Evans have all had great moments running the offense and have all shown that they can excel in the position, but the constant change and hitters having to adjust, I believe, has made it harder for hitters to get into a rhythm.\nSo, I looked a little further to see if there were similar trends on other Big Ten teams who qualified for the 2022 NCAA Tournament. Those teams include: Wisconsin, Nebraska, Minnesota, Ohio State, Penn State, and Purdue. I made a bubble chart of kills and blocks, with the weight of the bubbles being hitting percentage. I assumed that Kaitlyn Hord would have around the same number of blocks this season and last but that she would have fewer kills this season.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=newplayers, aes(x=K, y=BLK), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=KH, aes(x=K, y=BLK, size=PCT), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=othermiddles, aes(x=K, y=BLK, size=PCT), color=\"blue\") +\ngeom_text_repel(\n  data=othermiddles, aes(x=K, y=BLK, label=PlayerSeason), size=3\n) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n  data=KH, aes(x=K, y=BLK, label=PlayerSeason), size=3\n) +\n    labs(title=\"With fewer kills this season, Hord is still producing defensively.\", subtitle=\"The fifth-year transfer will likely exceed her 2021 blocking numbers by the end of the season.\", caption=\"Source: Team Websites | By Maddie Reisbig\")  + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nI took some of the best middles in the country both this season and last season and highlighted them in this bubble chart. 2021 Kaitlyn Hord’s stats are very impressive, as she is only slightly behind Wisconsin star, Dana Rettke. Slightly to the left of where Hord was last year is where she is this year. She has a similar amount of blocks, but far fewer kills. In fact, her former teammate, Allie Holland, has since surpassed her in kills.\nIf you go to a game at the Bob, you might hear people yelling to set the middle. After comparing Kaitlyn Hord’s stats from Penn State in 2021 and this year, it is obvious that she has the potential to be an All-American again, but is possibly just being underutilized. As the Cornhuskers head to Louisville for regionals, they will hopefully find a way to get their three-time All-American middle blocker more involved in the offense."

    "title": "Can the Selection Committee Justify More ACC Teams in the Tournament This Year?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Throughout the past decade the Big Ten has been widely known as being the premier volleyball conference, with the Pac-12 being a close second. However, in the past couple of years, there has been more and more talk about an up and coming ACC. This past season, two ACC teams made the Final Four, Pittsburgh and Louisville, along with two Big Ten teams, Nebraska and Wisconsin. There was a lot of hype surrounding the ACC teams going into the weekend, but ultimately, the Big Ten ended up sweeping the semifinals. The Big Ten was and is still better than the ACC in college volleyball, and there were two neutral site matches to prove it.\nI wanted to examine the number of sets played by each conferences’ member schools this season. By doing this, I realized that the Big Ten teams play a much harder conference schedule yet still get the job done.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nrankings <- read_csv(\"avcapollstats.csv\")\nvbdata <- read_csv(\"ncaa_womens_volleyball_matchstats_2022.csv\")\nplayers <- read_csv(\"ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2022.csv\")\n\nlongrankings <- rankings %>% rename(Conference = Conferemce) %>% filter(`10/31/22` <= 15) %>% pivot_longer(cols=c(-\"Team\", -\"Conference\"), names_to=\"Date\", values_to=\"Rank\") %>% mutate(Date = mdy(Date)) %>% filter(Rank > 0)\n\nlower <- as.Date(\"2022-07-25\")\nupper <- as.Date(\"2022-11-20\")\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nactiveplayers <- players %>% \nfilter(\n    s > 50 & \n      is.na(pos) == FALSE) %>%\n  filter(team %in% c(\"Wisconsin Badgers\", \"Ohio St. Buckeyes\", \"Nebraska Cornhuskers\", \"Pittsburgh Panthers\", \"Louisville Cardinals\", \"Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets\")) %>%\n  group_by(team) %>%\n  mutate(digsperset = digs/s)\n\ngt <- activeplayers %>% \n  filter(full_name == \"Paola Pimentel\")\nlv <- activeplayers %>% \n  filter(full_name == \"Elena Scott\")\nnu <- activeplayers %>% \n  filter(full_name == \"Lexi Rodriguez\")\nos <- activeplayers %>% \n  filter(full_name == \"Kylie Murr\")\npt <- activeplayers %>% \n  filter(full_name == \"Ashley Browske\")\nwi <- activeplayers %>% \n  filter(full_name == \"Gulce Guctekin\")\n\nbigdata <- vbdata %>%\n  filter(team %in% c(\"Nebraska Cornhuskers\", \"Iowa Hawkeyes\", \"Penn St. Nittany Lions\", \"Minnesota Golden Gophers\", \"Michigan Wolverines\", \"Michigan St. Spartans\",\"Northwestern Wildcats\", \"Purdue Boilermakers\", \"Indiana Hoosiers\", \"Maryland Terrapins, Terps\", \"Rutgers Scarlet Knights\", \"Wisconsin Badgers\", \"Ohio St. Buckeyes\", \"Illinois Fighting Illini\")) %>%\n  group_by(team) %>%\n  summarise(\n    totalsets = sum(s)\n  ) \n\naccdata <- vbdata %>%\n  filter(team %in% c(\"Boston College Eagles\", \"Clemson Tigers\", \"Duke Blue Devils\", \"Florida St. Seminoles\", \"Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets\", \"Louisville Cardinals\", \"Miami (FL) Hurricanes\", \"North Carolina Tar Heels\", \"NC State Wolfpack\", \"Notre Dame Fighting Irish\", \"Pittsburgh Panthers\", \"Syracuse Orange\", \"Virginia Cavaliers\", \"Virginia Tech Hokies\", \"Wake Forest Demon Deacons\")) %>%\n  group_by(team) %>%\n  summarise(\n    totalsets = sum(s)\n  )\n\neveryone <- bigdata <- vbdata %>%\n  filter(team %in% c(\"Nebraska Cornhuskers\", \"Iowa Hawkeyes\", \"Penn St. Nittany Lions\", \"Minnesota Golden Gophers\", \"Michigan Wolverines\", \"Michigan St. Spartans\",\"Northwestern Wildcats\", \"Purdue Boilermakers\", \"Indiana Hoosiers\", \"Maryland Terrapins, Terps\", \"Rutgers Scarlet Knights\", \"Wisconsin Badgers\", \"Ohio St. Buckeyes\", \"Illinois Fighting Illini\", \"Boston College Eagles\", \"Clemson Tigers\", \"Duke Blue Devils\", \"Florida St. Seminoles\", \"Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets\", \"Louisville Cardinals\", \"Miami (FL) Hurricanes\", \"North Carolina Tar Heels\", \"NC State Wolfpack\", \"Notre Dame Fighting Irish\", \"Pittsburgh Panthers\", \"Syracuse Orange\", \"Virginia Cavaliers\", \"Virginia Tech Hokies\", \"Wake Forest Demon Deacons\")) %>%\n  group_by(team) %>%\n  summarise(\n    totalsets = sum(s)\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=everyone, aes(x=reorder(team, -totalsets), weight=totalsets), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=bigdata, aes(x=reorder(team, -totalsets), weight=totalsets), fill=\"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data=accdata, aes(team, weight=totalsets), fill=\"dark grey\") +\n  coord_flip() +\nlabs(\n  x=\"\",\n    y=\"Sets Played\", \n    title=\"Does the number of sets played indicate the parity in a conference?\", \n    subtitle=\"Big Ten teams got the job done in timely fashion compared to ACC teams.\",\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Maddie Reisbig\"\n    ) +\n      theme_minimal() + \n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=8),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size=8),\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here, we can see that two of the top Big Ten teams play the least amount of sets out of all Big Ten and ACC teams. Compared to their conterparts, Louisville and Pitt, who rank much lower. This shows that the top Big Ten teams are better at getting the job done than the top ACC teams. Not only are they more efficient, but they are doing it against much tougher competition. Seven of the Ten teams that played the most sets are ACC teams. This shows that the bottom of the Big Ten is much stronger than the bottom of the ACC. Even the lower ranked Big Ten teams are battling with the top Big Ten teams. Take Iowa for example. The Hawkeyes are on the brink of a Big Ten win after taking both Purdue and Penn State to five, yet the are tied for last place in the Big Ten currently.\nOne thing that I believe hinders the visibility of Big Ten dominance is rankings and tournament seedings.\nEvery year, it seems as if the top Big Ten teams are all placed in the same regional or placed in the toughest regional, while there are other regionals that are not as difficult. But, what makes one team more deserving of a ranking than another, and how do you factor in strength of schedule. Big Ten teams are playing top teams day in and day out. What about San Diego though? They are currently the number two team in the nation. The Toreros had a successful preseason, defeating both Pittsburgh and Ohio State, but since preseason play, they have only faced two ranked teams.\nWhat would a regional look like at San Diego? Would San Diego be ready to face a Nebraska, a Wisconsin, or an Ohio State? I am going to say no. Not after these teams have spent a season in the Big Ten. Take a look at how San Diego has risen so quickly in the rankings over the course of the season. No other team has done this. The Toreros most likely will not drop in the rankings (unless there is an upset in the WCC).This means that it will be even more difficult for a Big Ten team to compete for that spot.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=longrankings, aes(x=Date, y=Rank, color=Team)) + \n  geom_point(data=longrankings, aes(x=Date, y=Rank, color=Team), size = 4)  + \n  geom_text(data = longrankings %>% filter(Date == min(Date)), aes(x = Date - 6, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = longrankings %>% filter(Date == max(Date)), aes(x = Date + 6, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n   scale_x_date(limits=c(lower, upper)) + \n   scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25)) +\n   scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#154734\",\"#005CA9\", \"#FA4616\", \"#B3A369\", \"#AD0000\", \"#7A0019\",\"#E41C38\", \"#BB0000\", \"#041E42\", \"#003594\", \"#CEB888\", \"#84BCE8\", \"#8C1515\", \"#BF5700\", \"#C5050C\")) +\n  labs(title=\"San Diego had a few big wins in preseason play but haven't been put to the test since.\", subtitle=\"Will the selection committe be able to justify a second seed and regional host with this resume?\", y= \"Rank\", x= \"Week\",\ncaption=\"Source: AVCA | By Maddie Reisbig\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n     plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=8),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size=8),\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nLet me pose a question to you. Assuming San Diego wins out, do they deserve a regional host over a Big Ten team who has a few more losses, only because of the tough conference they are in? We will leave that to the committee, but it will sure be interesting to follow as the bracket is revealed concluding regular season play.\nThe last thing I want to look at is digs. It makes sense that a game with longer rallies will have more digs, correct? Yes, of course! So, where do the liberos of the top three ACC and the top three Big Ten teams rank in digs per set?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=activeplayers, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset), color=\"light grey\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=gt, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset), color=\"yellow\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=lv, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset), color=\"red\") + \n    geom_beeswarm(\n    data=nu, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset), color=\"black\") + \n    geom_beeswarm(\n    data=os, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset), color=\"dark grey\") + \n    geom_beeswarm(\n    data=pt, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset), color=\"blue\") + \n    geom_beeswarm(\n    data=wi, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset), color=\"green\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=gt, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset, label=full_name)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=lv, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset, label=full_name)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=nu, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset, label=full_name)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=os, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset, label=full_name)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=pt, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset, label=full_name)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=wi, \n    aes(x=team, y=digsperset, label=full_name)) +\n  labs(\n  x=\"Team\",\n    y=\"Digs Per Set\", \n    title=\"The Big Ten averages more digs per set, indicating longer rallies.\", \n    subtitle=\"The top liberos in the Big Ten are still averaging more digs per set despite the tougher competition.\",\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Maddie Reisbig\"\n    ) +\n      theme_minimal() + \n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=8),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size=8),\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska libero, Lexi Rodriguez stands at the top of the list in digs per set, followed closely by Kylie Murr of Ohio State, Elena Scott of Louisville and Gulce Guctekin of Wisconsin. Other than Louisville, it is clear that the Big Ten has more digs per set, indicating longer rallies and better overall play than the ACC.\nI could go into many more examples on why the Big Ten is still the dominant conference in college volleyball despite the hype around the ACC. These charts give some insight into why the Big Ten is still the best, but come tournament time, we will the Big Ten prove themselves through their play."
